Pinned to the top are `Plugins`, `Templates`, and `gems` to help you locate things a little easier. Documentation is in the [`_docs`](https://github.com/jekyllgems/_docs) repo where you can find everything from Installation to contributing to projects. You can also view them along with other project docs on the website. 

## General Purpose

I just wanted to create a website for showcasing gems, templates, and plugins I created. I also use the jekyll naming convention when publishing them, but before that I host and work on them on my linux server. When I started developing jekyll themes and learning how the whole theme / template / gem system worked it became obvious to me and my ocd that it was going to make me kinda crazy. I wanted one site to rule them all, not `gem push` something and then upload the template somewhere else, then email another site to showcase the theme. So I made [this site](https://jekyllgems.dev).
