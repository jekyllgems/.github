## Hi there 👋

Just setting up and creating repos. Pinned to the top are "Plugins" and "Templates" to help you locate things a little easier. These are the repos. You can locate the gems on [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org) after they are developed. They use the typical Jekyll naming convention of jekyll-{projectName} which you can find on their respective pages on rubygems or on my site ate https://jekyllgems.dev
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
