Just setting up and creating repos. Pinned to the top are `Plugins`, `Templates`, and `gems` to help you locate things a little easier. These are the repos. You can locate the gems on [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org) after they are developed. They use the typical Jekyll naming convention of `jekyll-{projectName}` which you can find on their respective pages on rubygems or on my site at https://jekyllgems.dev any issues you run into (including broken links) please open an issues in the ["Gems"](https://github.com/jekyllgems/gems) repo. I use that to keep track of all issues in gems I produce. Documentation is in the ["Docs"](https://github.com/jekyllgems/docs) repo where you can find everything from Installation to contributing to projects.
